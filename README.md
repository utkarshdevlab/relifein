#Relife.
A project for change

Problem Statement : 

Technology’s promise to keep us connected has given rise to a host of unintended consequences that are catching up with us. Along with the good comes the bad. With all of its benefits, the nature of social media presents a range of potential issues.

Online vs Reality. Social media itself is not the problem. It is the way people use it in place of actual communication and in-person socializing. “Friends” on social media may not actually be friends, and may even be strangers.

Increased usage. The more time spent on social media can lead to cyberbullying, social anxiety, depression, and exposure to content that is not age appropriate.

Social Media is addictive. When you’re playing a game or accomplishing a task, you seek to do it as well as you can. Once you succeed, your brain will give you a dose of dopamine and other happiness hormones, making you happy. The same mechanism functions when you post a picture to Instagram or Facebook. Once you see all the notifications for likes and positive comments popping up on your screen, you’ll subconsciously register it as a reward. But that’s not all, social media is full of mood-modifying experiences.

Fear of Missing Out. FOMO has become a common theme, and often leads to continual checking of social media sites. The idea that you might miss out on something if you’re not online can affect your mental health.

Self-image issues. Social media sites provide tools that allow people to earn others’ approval for their appearance and the possibility to compare themselves to others. It can be associated with body image concerns. The “selfieholics” and people who spend most of their time posting and scrolling are the ones most vulnerable to this. In fact, most college girls who use Facebook at least five times a day are likely to link their self-worth to their looks. That doesn’t mean that the main problem is social media; it only provides a medium for it, which further elevates the problem. It also promotes the same sort of behavior to others.

Limitations : 
When we are talking about the 21st century, we are talking about paced up lives which immensely leads to lonely life. This needs to be tackled by connecting people living far and the bridge is social media. But by going on techbreak or using digital wellbeing, one might again feel the loneliness around and feel far away from the world. 
In the age of information, social media, even after being biassed, might come handy when you are looking for trending news or general knowledge. Going offline might push you far from current affairs. 
Even hundreds of experiments had already been done in order to find the appropriate ways to ensure digital wellbeing, but till now, we are still hopeless with the right method. As long as social media is targeting the dopamine release in the brain of the user, it is going to be in use on priority. 
This project is still in the research phase and we nearly dont have the base to start with the development, so we might face the time constraint, which might decrease the quality of the application.
